		/*ArrayList methods:
			add (index, Object) - This methods adds Object at the given index in the ArrayList. This causes all of the other objects to shift.

			get (index) - This method retrieves an object at the index in the ArrayList. It does not remove the object.
			set (index, Object) - This method will replace the object at index with Object in the ArrayList.
			size()- This method returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.
			remove (index)- This method removes the object at index in the ArrayList. This causes all of the other objects to shift.*/
